Hi! I'm glad that you are here to inspect my work samples
Take these steps to run this code : 

1> Open VS code
2> Go to file -> open foulder and select the foulder you would like to run
3> Open bootstrap_second_round.html from the list on the left
4> Right click on the page on choose open in default browser

BTW. If it is too time taking for you to install VS Code or run this code you can easily take a look at the mockups I have put in the main foulder. They are screenshots I have taken from my code running on browser.
BTW#2. I'm always available on email (thisisrosemillerr@gmail.com) or Upwork chats, so keep in touch

Let's go for our amazing co-operation!

Rose Miller
